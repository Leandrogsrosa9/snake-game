These certificates are the longest messages sent through the network. Certificate compression is aimed to decrease the length of the certificate by encoding the certificate. From our observations, the encoded certificates are 20-25% less long than the actual certificates. In this experiment, we would like to ensure several things. First, as certificates are critical for the connection, we would to make sure that enabling the certificate compression will not introduce any problems. Second, we would like to establish the performance gain when we have each of the different encoders switched on. Finally, we want to find out which encoder is the best (which encoder gives the best difference between the actual length and the encoded length). It will allow us to propose the best decoder first (giving it a bigger chance to be selected and used).\n\nThe certificate compression experiment has already run in Beta, now we are targeting the
